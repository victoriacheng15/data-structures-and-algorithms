## 002 Century from Year

Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

## 003 Check Palindrome

Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.

## 004 Adjacent Element Product

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

## 005 Shape Area

Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

if n = 1, poly = 1
if n = 2, poly = 5
if n = 3, poly = 13

[Solution](./solutions/intro/005-shape-area.test.js)

## 006 Shape Area

Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed

## 007 Almost Increasing Sequence

Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

## 008 Matrix Elements Sum

After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.
