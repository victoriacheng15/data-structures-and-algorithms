## 001 Add

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/001-add.test.js)

## 002 Century from Year

Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/002-century-from-year.test.js)

## 003 Check Palindrome

Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/003-check-palindrome.test.js)

## 004 Adjacent Element Product

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/004-adjacent-element-product.test.js)

## 005 Shape Area

Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

if n = 1, poly = 1
if n = 2, poly = 5
if n = 3, poly = 13

[Solution](./solutions/intro/005-shape-area.test.js)

## 006 Shape Area

Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed

## 007 Almost Increasing Sequence

Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

## 008 Matrix Elements Sum

After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

## 009 All Longest Strings

Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/009-all-longest-strings.test.js)

## 010 Common Character Count

Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/010-common-characater-count.test.js)

## 011 Is Lucky

Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half

[Solution](./solutions/intro/011-is-lucky.test.js)

## 012 Sort By Height

Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

[Solution](./solutions/intro/012-sort-by-height.test.js)

## 013 Reverse In Parenthese

Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.

Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/013-reverse-in-parentheses.test.js)

## 014 Alternating Sum

Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.

You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/014-alternating-sums.test.js)


## 015 Add border

Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/015-add-border.test.js)

## 016 Are Similar

Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/016-are-similiar.test.js)

## 017 Array Change

You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/017-array-change.test.js)

## 018 Palindrome Rearranging

Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

[Solution](./solutions/intro/018-palindrome-rearranging.test.js)

## 019 Are Equally Strong

Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.

Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.

Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong..
